# SportsPred_Capstone

# Description
Develop model to accurately make sports outcome predictions. To start we will be looking at NBA player prop predictions e.g. how many points, rebounds, assists a player will have in a game. This is a common bet available on sportsbooks, and we hope to create a model that will beat the markets despite the associated market cost, or vig. 

Our 2nd initiative is to predict tennis matches.

We chose these because new data had been made available on ## INSERT SITE ## . For tennis matches they include the betting lines.

# Project Goals

Identify betting opportunities with associated confidence intervals
Develop database to store data and bet history
Create interface that deploys model and also stores bet activity in the database

# Key Questions

Can we beat the market?
What opportunities are the most profitable?
What features are most important, and what missing features might well inform our data?
How do we efficiently store our data?

# Steps

1. Reading in data and wrangling
2. EDA
3. FE 
4. Modeling
5. Concluding results
6. Build databases to store bet history (and training data?)
7. Streamlit UI for prediction interface
8. Connect UI to update bet history database
